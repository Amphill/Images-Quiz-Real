	So this is a rose and its nice and stuff. Its used to represent love; which, I don't understand because they are prickly and can hurt people. Aside from being sharp, they is expensive. Who wants a plant that hurts? And why is a hurty flower so expensive? I wonder who/what/when/why/how it got chosen to rep love and such. *Shrugs*

	So these look like flowers but they actually aren't.
	This is just fruit shaped like flowers and sold at an even higher price than flowers. This is a prime example of capitalism and consumerism in the US. They taste good though.
